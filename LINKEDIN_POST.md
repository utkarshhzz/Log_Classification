# LinkedIn Post Template for Your Log Classification Project

🚀 **Excited to share my latest AI/ML project: Log Classification System!** 🔍

I've built an intelligent multi-tier log classification system that automatically categorizes system logs using a combination of:

✅ Regex Pattern Matching (for speed)
✅ BERT Embeddings + ML Classifier (for accuracy)
✅ LLM Integration (for complex cases)

## 🎯 Key Features:
- FastAPI REST API with full documentation
- Interactive web interface for live demos
- Handles 8+ log categories (Authentication, Backup, Updates, etc.)
- Smart fallback strategy for optimal performance
- Production-ready code with comprehensive testing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python | FastAPI | Sentence Transformers
- Scikit-learn | Groq LLM API
- BERT Embeddings | Machine Learning

## 📊 Use Cases:
Perfect for DevOps teams, system administrators, and anyone dealing with large volumes of logs who needs automated classification for monitoring, alerting, or analysis.

## 🌐 Try it Live:
Check out the interactive demo and explore the code on GitHub!

## 🎥 What to Include in Your Post:

### Option 1: Screenshots to Share
1. **API Documentation Screenshot** (http://localhost:8000/docs)
2. **Demo UI Screenshot** (http://localhost:8000/)
3. **Code snippet** showing the classification logic
4. **Results/Output** showing successful classifications

### Option 2: Video Demo (Recommended!)
Record a 30-60 second screen recording showing:
1. Opening the demo UI
2. Selecting different log sources
3. Entering example logs
4. Showing real-time classification results

### Option 3: Carousel Post
Create 3-5 slides:
1. **Slide 1**: Project title + description
2. **Slide 2**: Architecture diagram (regex → BERT → LLM)
3. **Slide 3**: Demo UI screenshot
4. **Slide 4**: API documentation screenshot
5. **Slide 5**: GitHub repo + call to action

## 📸 How to Capture Screenshots:

### For API Docs:
1. Run: `python main.py`
2. Open: http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Screenshot the Swagger UI

### For Demo UI:
1. Run: `python main.py`
2. Open: http://localhost:8000/
3. Fill in an example and classify
4. Screenshot the results

### For Code:
Share snippets from:
- `classify.py` - Main classification logic
- `main.py` - FastAPI endpoints
